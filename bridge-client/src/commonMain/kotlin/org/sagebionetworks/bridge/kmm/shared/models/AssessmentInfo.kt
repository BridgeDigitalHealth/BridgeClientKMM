/**
 * Information about an assessment in order to render it in a UI prior to execution.
 * @param key Because assessments can be configured with different display information, they are not referenced in the schedule portion of a timeline by their GUIDs. Instead they are given a unique string key that is used to look up the assessment.
 * @param guid Each assessment revision is assigned a unique GUID which can be used to retrieve it through the API. Assessments will also have a unique combination of an identifier and a revision, and can be retrieved as a set of revisions under a given identifier.
 * @param appId
 * @param identifier A human-readable identifier for an assessment, which can have one or more revisions.
 * @param revision The revision of the assessment under the given identifier (the identifier and the revision together are mapped to a single GUID which can be used to reference the assessment; only the GUID is required in this object).
 * @param label
 * @param minutesToComplete The number of minutes it takes for a participant to complete this assessment.
 * @param colorScheme
 * @param configUrl The URL to download the configuration associated with this assessment.
